Here's a query that looks for a user taking a high number of screenshots using the top 5 most common screenshot tools and uploading them to cloud image hosting sites, using Defender for Endpoint data:

```
// Query for detecting high volume of screenshots and uploads to cloud image hosting sites
let screenshot_tools = dynamic(["SnippingTool.exe", "Greenshot.exe", "Lightshot.exe", "PicPick.exe", "ScreenshotCaptor.exe"]);
let image_upload_sites = dynamic(["imgur.com", "postimg.cc", "ibb.co", "imgbb.com", "sli.mg"]);
let days = 1;

DeviceFileEvents

This query looks for the use of the top 5 most common screenshot tools and checks whether the user has been uploading them to cloud image hosting sites. The query looks for FileEvents that create, modify, or delete image files with extensions `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp`, `.gif`, and `.tiff`. It filters for specific directories such as `Pictures` and `Downloads` and checks for the use of screenshot tools like Snipping Tool, Greenshot, Lightshot, PicPick, and ScreenshotCaptor. 

It then joins these FileEvents with other FileEvents that are
